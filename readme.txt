Our Simulator:
• Requires a starting address inputted in the beginning
• Has two input modes, reading from file.txt or manual inputting of instructions
• Has two separate memories (instruction and data)
• Instructions have format: instruction_name param1,param2,param3
• In the input.txt file, any block of instructions needs to be preceded by .text
and any block of data by .data, there can be several blocks of instructions and data
• Currently, our simulator merely takes the input and displays the values at the 
relevant instruction memory addresses to confirm that the input has been correctly
received (validation is included).
• Basis for the next milestone was laid out (class hierarchy made to accommodate
future implementation).
